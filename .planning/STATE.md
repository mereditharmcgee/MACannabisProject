## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 27 requirements with fine granularity; research-suggested 5-phase structure expanded at natural boundaries
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 (Trust and Legal) depends only on Phase 3, enabling potential parallel execution with Phases 4-6
- [01-01]: Used @tailwindcss/vite plugin for Tailwind CSS v4 (not deprecated @astrojs/tailwind)
- [01-01]: Renamed default branch from master to main for Cloudflare Pages compatibility
- [01-01]: Added legacy project files to .gitignore to keep repo clean
- [02-01]: Used vitest resolve alias to map astro/zod to standalone zod for test compatibility
- [02-01]: Whitelisted tests/fixtures/*.xlsx in .gitignore for test fixture tracking
- [02-01]: Special status tags parsed from comma/semicolon-delimited string, unrecognized values silently ignored
- [02-02]: Used tsconfig paths alias for astro/zod -> zod in tsx script context
- [02-02]: Dispensary JSON entries include 'id' field (licenseNumber) for Astro file() loader
- [02-02]: Content Collections schema defined inline in content.config.ts using astro/zod
- [02-02]: Unblocked scripts/ directory in .gitignore for build tooling

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Ownership narrative content strategy needed before Phase 3 -- 525 unique narratives required to avoid thin content penalties
- [Research]: Owner group page normalization rules needed in Phase 2 -- same person operating under multiple LLCs
- [Research]: Correction form tooling (Formspree, Google Forms, etc.) needs evaluation before Phase 7
